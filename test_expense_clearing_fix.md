# Expense Clearing Form Fix Test

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: `ReferenceError: result is not defined` when generating PDF
- **Cause**: The `result` variable was declared inside a try block but used outside of it
- **Solution**: Moved the `result` variable declaration to the proper scope

## Changes Made
1. Declared `let result: any;` before the try block in `processFormSubmission` function
2. Removed duplicate toast message
3. Improved error handling for PDF generation

## Test Steps
1. Fill out the expense clearing form
2. Add at least one expense item with name and used amount
3. Submit the form with digital signature
4. Verify that:
   - Form submits successfully
   - PDF is generated without errors
   - Success message is shown
   - User is redirected back

## Expected Behavior
- Form should submit successfully
- PDF should be generated and uploaded to Supabase
- No "result is not defined" error should occur
- Single success toast message should be displayed
